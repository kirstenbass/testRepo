# testRepo
1st test repository. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for man kind.

My name is Kirsten Bass. I am a student at UNF pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems, and am anticipating graduating in the summer of 2016. I obtained my AA from FSCJ, where I was a member of their Women's Chorus and College Chorale. I was once even allowed to sing tenor in the Men's chorus, which was a ginormous goal of mine. This is probably too much info for a repo, but oh well!
